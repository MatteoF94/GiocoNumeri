# GiocoNumeri
Simple shell/prompt game where the client has to remember a list of numbers sent by the server. When accessing the server, the client has 
to log in giving the couple username and password. If there is no player with such username a new record in the scoreboard is created (register process).
After that, the player can play the game (p), see the records in the scoreboard (r) or just quit the game (q). 
Something about the gameplay. The server sends to the player a list of randomic generated numbers within a fixed range. Starting from just one
number, for each correct "answer" of the player, the list increases by one element. The player has to remember the list, which will be shown
on his terminal for a short amount of time, and communicate it to the server. If it is correct, the game will continue, otherwise the match 
will end, and the player will find itself in the choice menu once again (p,r or q). 
HAVE FUN PLAYING!
